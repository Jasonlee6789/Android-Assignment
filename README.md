# Android-Assignment
My App is an Android App, it can help some customers to order the  weekly fruit packages on the app to implement the following functions:

Real time :App solves the problem of older system only access by email ,it was really inconvenient for the real time operation . it can be seen by app anytime now. (Database CRUD)

Picture content : App also solves the older system problem that canâ€™t  be able to wander every week fruit packages in advance. 

Convenience : It is helpful to management by Mobile App for the boss.
I use the following Technical Methodologies:
Design layout of different Activity to complish the order process.
SQLite Database implementation and management(CRUD functions_DbHandler) have made the App become a better product to use , User can manage the order information and CRUD in one phone .
Toolbar-NavigationDrawer
GridView and GridItemView 
Basic Methodologies like Intent , Input, Adapter, Toolbar, Menu,UI Test etc.
